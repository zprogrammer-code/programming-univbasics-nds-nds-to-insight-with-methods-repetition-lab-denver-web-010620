# Derive Insight from NDS Using Methods...Repeated

## Learning Goals

* Create a "First-Order" method

## Introduction

In the previous lab we saw how wrapping "raw" use of Ruby primitive
instructions (REEPETITION, `Array` methods, etc.) into methods makes it easier
for humans to reason about code.

However, we can create code that is easier to maintain, clearer and more
beautiful if we wrap "First-Order" methods inside of _other methods_. In the
same way that we nested "raw" `[]`,  `Hash`, and `Array` methods _inside_
"First-Order" methods, we can nest "First-Order" methods _inside_ other
methods.

When code is structured this way, there are many benefits:

* It's easier to debug
* It's more obvious to read
* It's more easy to get help with online

## Starting Point

First, let's start with some common "starter" code.

```ruby
vm = [[[{:name=>"Vanilla Cookies", :pieces=>3}, {:name=>"Pistachio Cookies",
:pieces=>3}, {:name=>"Chocolate Cookies", :pieces=>3}, {:name=>"Chocolate Chip
Cookies", :pieces=>3}], [{:name=>"Tooth-Melters", :pieces=>12},
{:name=>"Tooth-Destroyers", :pieces=>12}, {:name=>"Enamel Eaters",
:pieces=>12}, {:name=>"Dentist's Nighmare", :pieces=>20}], [{:name=>"Gummy Sour
Apple", :pieces=>3}, {:name=>"Gummy Apple", :pieces=>5}, {:name=>"Gummy Moldy
Apple", :pieces=>1}]], [[{:name=>"Grape Drink", :pieces=>1}, {:name=>"Orange
Drink", :pieces=>1}, {:name=>"Pineapple Drink", :pieces=>1}], [{:name=>"Mints",
:pieces=>13}, {:name=>"Curiously Toxic Mints", :pieces=>1000}, {:name=>"US
Mints", :pieces=>99}]]]

def total_snack_pieces_on_spinner(nds, row_index, column_index)
  coordinate_total = 0
  inner_len = nds[row_index][column_index].length
  inner_index = 0
  while inner_index < inner_len do
    coordinate_total += nds[row_index][column_index][inner_index][:pieces]
    inner_index += 1
  end
  coordinate_total
end

grand_piece_total = 0
row_index = 0
while row_index < vm.length do
  column_index = 0
  while column_index < vm[row_index].length do
    grand_piece_total += total_snack_pieces_on_spinner(vm, row_index,
column_index)
    column_index += 1
  end
  row_index += 1
end

p grand_piece_total #=> 1192
```

## Wrap a First-Order Method

Looking at the starter code, the inner-most part is _still_ not so easy to
reason about. Let's zoom in to it:

```ruby
# Non-Runnable!
while row_index < vm.length do
  column_index = 0
  while column_index < vm[row_index].length do
    grand_piece_total += total_snack_pieces_on_spinner(vm, row_index, column_index)
    column_index += 1
  end
  row_index += 1
end
```

That inner-most `while` _means_ "go to each spinner on the row, and total it
up".  That is, "**total up the row based on its spinners**." Wouldn't it be
GREAT if there were a method called `total_snack_pieces_in_row`? Again, there's
nothing stopping us from making it!

***Here's the crucial insight about how we'll write the new method***: a row is
made up of spinners. So all we have to do to total a row's snack count is add
together the snack counts of its spinners. Let's update the code:

```ruby
vm = [[[{:name=>"Vanilla Cookies", :pieces=>3}, {:name=>"Pistachio Cookies", :pieces=>3}, {:name=>"Chocolate Cookies", :pieces=>3}, {:name=>"Chocolate Chip Cookies", :pieces=>3}], [{:name=>"Tooth-Melters", :pieces=>12}, {:name=>"Tooth-Destroyers", :pieces=>12}, {:name=>"Enamel Eaters", :pieces=>12}, {:name=>"Dentist's Nighmare", :pieces=>20}], [{:name=>"Gummy Sour Apple", :pieces=>3}, {:name=>"Gummy Apple", :pieces=>5}, {:name=>"Gummy Moldy Apple", :pieces=>1}]], [[{:name=>"Grape Drink", :pieces=>1}, {:name=>"Orange Drink", :pieces=>1}, {:name=>"Pineapple Drink", :pieces=>1}], [{:name=>"Mints", :pieces=>13}, {:name=>"Curiously Toxic Mints", :pieces=>1000}, {:name=>"US Mints", :pieces=>99}]]]

def total_snack_pieces_on_spinner(nds, row_index, column_index)
  coordinate_total = 0
  inner_len = nds[row_index][column_index].length
  inner_index = 0
  while inner_index < inner_len do
    coordinate_total += nds[row_index][column_index][inner_index][:pieces]
    inner_index += 1
  end
  coordinate_total
end

def total_snack_pieces_in_row(nds, row_index)
  grand_row_total = 0
  column_index = 0
  while column_index < nds[row_index].length do
    grand_row_total += total_snack_pieces_on_spinner(nds, row_index, column_index)
    column_index += 1
  end
  grand_row_total
end

grand_piece_total = 0
row_index = 0
while row_index < vm.length do
  grand_piece_total += total_snack_pieces_in_row(vm, row_index)
  row_index += 1
end

p grand_piece_total #=> 1192
```

## Wrap an Additional Method

Suddenly all that's left in our original kinda-messy "raw" implementation  is
the following:

```ruby
# Non-Runnable

grand_piece_total = 0
row_index = 0
while row_index < vm.length do
  grand_piece_total += total_snack_pieces_in_row(vm, row_index)
  row_index += 1
end
```

But this bit of code has a purpose. What does this code _mean_? What is it
trying to accomplish?

Isn't it "sum up the counts of all the rows" the same thing as seeking
"`total_snack_pieces_in_machine`?" Just as before, we're going to "wrap"
`total_snack_pieces_in_row` into a new method: `total_snack_pieces_in_machine`.

```ruby
vm = [[[{:name=>"Vanilla Cookies", :pieces=>3}, {:name=>"Pistachio Cookies", :pieces=>3}, {:name=>"Chocolate Cookies", :pieces=>3}, {:name=>"Chocolate Chip Cookies", :pieces=>3}], [{:name=>"Tooth-Melters", :pieces=>12}, {:name=>"Tooth-Destroyers", :pieces=>12}, {:name=>"Enamel Eaters", :pieces=>12}, {:name=>"Dentist's Nighmare", :pieces=>20}], [{:name=>"Gummy Sour Apple", :pieces=>3}, {:name=>"Gummy Apple", :pieces=>5}, {:name=>"Gummy Moldy Apple", :pieces=>1}]], [[{:name=>"Grape Drink", :pieces=>1}, {:name=>"Orange Drink", :pieces=>1}, {:name=>"Pineapple Drink", :pieces=>1}], [{:name=>"Mints", :pieces=>13}, {:name=>"Curiously Toxic Mints", :pieces=>1000}, {:name=>"US Mints", :pieces=>99}]]]

def total_snack_pieces_on_spinner(nds, row_index, column_index)
  coordinate_total = 0
  inner_len = nds[row_index][column_index].length
  inner_index = 0
  while inner_index < inner_len do
    coordinate_total += nds[row_index][column_index][inner_index][:pieces]
    inner_index += 1
  end
  coordinate_total
end

def total_snack_pieces_in_row(nds, row_index)
  grand_row_total = 0
  column_index = 0
  while column_index < nds[row_index].length do
    grand_row_total += total_snack_pieces_on_spinner(nds, row_index, column_index)
    column_index += 1
  end
  grand_row_total
end

def total_snack_pieces_in_machine(nds)
  grand_piece_total = 0
  row_index = 0
  while row_index < nds.length do
    grand_piece_total += total_snack_pieces_in_row(nds, row_index)
    row_index += 1
  end
  grand_piece_total
end

p total_snack_pieces_in_machine(vm) #=> 1192
```

Wow! That's really handy! Instead of one triple-nested `while` loop, we now
have **three** helpful methods that will help hide away complexity and keep our
code readable and maintainable.

From the perspective of generating _insight_, our code knows what _insight_
**we** want and what _insight_ **it is ready to share**. This code makes it
easy to find by calling a method whose name immediately suggest the _insight_
we want: `total_snack_pieces_in_machine`. The method then, internally, uses
_other_ methods to help keep itself clean and simple:

```text
total_snack_pieces_in_machine
 \-> total_snack_pieces_in_row
    \-> total_snack_pieces_on_spinner
```

## Lab

In the lab you're going to write a method that uses First-Order methods to do
its work.

## Conclusion

Whenever you have complex data that needs to be "transformed," "massaged," or
"changed," let _methods_ help your human brain keep track of the constituent
actions that need to happen to create the _insights_ you need. Compare this
last bit of code with the first "raw `[]` and `Array` methods" implementation.
Which version would _you_ rather debug? Which is easier to talk about and ask
for help with?

What's even more interesting, is that as your collection of "First-Order"
methods grows, you'll find yourself writing methods that mix their outputs
together to create new _insights_. Eventually, you might have so many
well-written, tiny, clear "First-Order" methods that reasoning about,
explaining, and extending your code is simple. That's the goal.
